Description:  Provides a PAM module that can obtain a proxy delegation from a
	      MyProxy service. The user should store his credentials using
	      his/her DN as username and a password. The PAM module will ask for
	      the MyProxy password and either store a proxy delegation plus
	      private key in memory for a next PAM module, or write it to disk
	      as PEM file.
	      This PEM file can be used to do actual authentication via e.g.
	      LCMAPS with the planned pam_lcmapsd module.
	      Options can be given either on the pam commandline or in a config
	      file which can be specified on the pam commandline.
	      Valid options:
	        config      - only on commandline: specifies path of config file
	        cafile	    - as understood by openssl
		capath      - idem
		hostcert    - idem (corresponding to clientcert)
		hostkey     - idem
		myproxyhost - MyProxy service hostaddress
		myproxyport - MyProxy service port (default 7512)
		proxyfmt    - formatstring for proxy filename, a %d is
		              replaced by the active username, it should end
			      with XXXXXX following mkstemp()
			      (default /tmp/x509up_XXXXXX)
		writeproxy  - 0 don't write proxy, non-zero write proxy
		              (default 1)
		lifetime    - proxy lifetime in seconds (should be less than 1
		              billion, default 43200L)
		keysize     - bitsize of keys (default 2048)
	      The pam module only provides pam_sm_authenticate and
	      pam_sm_setcred. The latter sets a X509_USER_PROXY env variable
	      pointing to the proxy file (in case the proxy is written to file).

Example:      E.g.:
                auth     optional     pam_myproxy.so config=/etc/security/pam_myproxy.conf myproxyhost=px.grid.sara.nl
		
Notes:        Actual authentication needs to be done by another pam module.
